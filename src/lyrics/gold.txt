You want something
That can't be bought OH
You want something
That can't be taught OH

You want a love
But you don't wanna wait for it
You want a thug
But you don't wanna say it
I need a hug and a cup of bacon
Stir it on up and we'll say we were fakin' it

I can't help takin' love from you babe
Even if I ain't got the gold to pay
And I can't help makin' love to you babe
Every little penny would be worth the save
