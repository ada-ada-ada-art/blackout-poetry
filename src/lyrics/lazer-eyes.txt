I know that you wanna control me
I know you think that you're head of the army

But I am the captain the general the king
This is my castle my ship my terrain
Get your own gun baby get your own game

Don't tell me
How to fire my
Don't tell me
How to fire my
Gun

Ohhhhhh

You are in the tree 
I am on the ground
It doesn't make you taller and you can't come down
You say you know God and that Jesus is dead
But your animal laser eyes killed them
YEAH YOUR ANIMAL LAZER EYES KILLED THEM
